# MySQL Burger

## Overview
In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. This follows the MVC design pattern, and is deployed on Heroku using JawsDB.

## Walkthrough
A full walkthrough of the application is available [here]"https://youtu.be/JnnbbqoubhA".

##Running the Application
As the application is hosted on Heroku, you can run it [here]"https://afternoon-springs-15789.herokuapp.com/". If you wish to clone the GitHub repo to run the application locally, you can do so [here]"https://www.github.com/patrickeast/burger/".

##Looking Forward
I'm excited to use Sequelize next week to overhaul this app and make it much more efficient. I also want to add a delete button to both "Available Burgers" and the "Devoured Burgers" sections on the site, so that the list doesn't become unruly as people update the site with their orders.
